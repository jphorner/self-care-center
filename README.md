# Self Care center

The Self Care Center is a web page which generates random mantras and affirmations at the click of a button.


## Usage

There is no installation required; all features are contained within the web page.

**Page Load**
- Upon loading, the page's element containers appear one-by-one.

**Message Selection**
- Selecting 'mantra' or 'affirmation' from the radio buttons will determine the type of message you receive.
- Once you have chosen your preferred message type, clicking 'Receive Message' will make your random message appear.
- If no message type is selected, clicking 'Receive Message' will generate a message prompting the user to select an option.

**Clear Message**
- If you dislike your message and want to return to the default display, click 'Clear Message'.
- The message box will now display a default meditation icon instead of a message.
- A new message can be generated at any time after the box is cleared.
